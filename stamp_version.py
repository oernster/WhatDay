"""Stamp the version from VERSION into the WhatDay site.

A browser rendering the site cannot read VERSION, so every place the site shows a
version carries a delimited token: <!--VERSION-->x.y.z<!--/VERSION-->. This script
rewrites whatever sits between the delimiters. VERSION stays the one place a real
version string is written by hand.

The site only, deliberately: docs/**/*.html and docs/**/*.md. Markdown at the
repository root holds no version by rule, so it is never a target.

Idempotent. A file already carrying the current version is left alone rather than
rewritten, so a second run changes nothing and says so. Files are read and written as
bytes, so their line endings survive a stamp on any platform.

A missing or empty VERSION is a failure rather than a sentinel: the build calls this
script and has to stop instead of publishing a number nobody chose.
